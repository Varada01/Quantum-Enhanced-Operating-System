# QEOS – Quantum-Enhanced Operating System part of Coherence Quest's CQhack25.

> 🚀 Built with **Classiq** for quantum circuit synthesis and optimization.  
> Integrates quantum algorithms into OS-level scheduling, memory management, networking, and security.

QEOS is a quantum-inspired operating system kernel designed to integrate quantum optimization and security techniques directly into core OS services.
It provides quantum-native modules for scheduling, memory management, networking, file systems, and system monitoring — all while remaining compatible with classical applications.

🚀 Features
QPS – Quantum Process Scheduler
Uses QAOA-based optimization to balance latency, energy, and throughput in CPU scheduling.

QMM – Quantum Memory Manager
Treats memory allocation as a quantum optimization problem to reduce fragmentation and improve efficiency.

QSE – Quantum Security Engine
Implements quantum-generated random keys and entanglement-based security checks for anomaly detection.

QFSI – Quantum File System Intelligence
Accelerates file indexing and retrieval with Grover’s search algorithm.

QNS – Quantum Network Stack
Finds optimal low-latency, low-congestion routing paths using quantum-assisted optimization.

QSI – Quantum System Intelligence
Monitors performance metrics in quantum superposition for rapid anomaly detection.

🛠 Architecture
QEOS operates within the QEOS Kernel Layer, leveraging the Classiq Runtime Engine on standard hardware.
Classical system calls ensure compatibility, meaning existing applications can seamlessly benefit from quantum-enhanced performance.
